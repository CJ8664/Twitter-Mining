# Statistical sentiment analysis of Twitter as a review platform

Reviews being the most important thing in deciding whether
to visit a place or not and having a genuine review is the
most essential part. Generally, reviews available on websites
and platform such as Yelp are more inclined to the
positive aspects of a place. Moreover, the amount of usage
of social media platforms has increased also, these platforms
contain posts which expresses userâ€™s opinion in a better way.
Twitter being an important contributor, understanding the
reliability of such tweets of being reviews is also important.
To examine this, we have devised various approaches using
natural language processing to analyze the tweets and obtain
a statistical analysis of the same based on metadata
obtains from tweets.
